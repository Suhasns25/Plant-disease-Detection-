	Data Collection and Preprocessing:
	Dataset: Gathered images of various plant species affected by different diseases from publicly available repositories or collected through domain-            specific sources.

•	Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to enhance model generalization and performance.
•	Model Development:

•	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
•	Architecture: Designed a CNN architecture comprising convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for spatial down sampling.

•	Training: Trained the CNN on the labeled dataset using TensorFlow/Kara’s, optimizing for accuracy and minimizing loss through backpropagation.

•       Web Application Development:

•	Flask Integration: Developed a Flask-based web application to serve as the interface for users to upload   plant images.
•	Model Deployment: Integrated the trained CNN model with Flask to perform real-time predictions on uploaded images.
•	User Interface: Designed an intuitive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance user experience and facilitate interaction.
